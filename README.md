# ceph_micro-cookbook

This cookbook installs ceph using Lo√Øc Dachary script described in
[this article](http://dachary.org/?p=2374).

Eventually here is the result:

```bash
vagrant@default-ubuntu-1204:/vagrant$ ceph -c  /tmp/micro-ceph/ceph.conf  -s
    cluster e3a14890-0e60-4310-b5c5-54117d04f876
     health HEALTH_OK
     monmap e1: 1 mons at {0=127.0.0.1:6789/0}, election epoch 2, quorum 0 0
     osdmap e5: 1 osds: 1 up, 1 in
      pgmap v41: 72 pgs, 2 pools, 658 bytes data, 1 objects
            2273 MB used, 35045 MB / 39316 MB avail
                  72 active+clean
```

This is not suitable for production environment, but is very convenient for
testing.
